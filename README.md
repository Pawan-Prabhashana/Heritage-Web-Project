# Heritage-Web-Project
The Heritage Website was developed for a university module with the purpose of giving the artisans a digital presence and connecting them to wider markets. The website is an all-in-one marketplace where clients can browse and purchase traditional hand-crafted products, book cultural experiences, and learn about the artisans and their stories.
